INTRODUCTION AND USAGE                    *sunset* *sunset-introduction-usage*

Sunset automatically sets |'background'| when the sun rises and sets, and also
when you start Vim. When the sun is up, or rises, it'll
'set background=light'. When the sun is down, or sets,
it'll 'set background=dark'.

So as not to interrupt you, Sunset waits for four seconds (on the
|CursorHold| event) after you've pressed a key or left insert mode before
changing the background. If you change your background during the day or
night, it'll respect that.

You must set some options in your `.vimrc` for Sunset to work, so
please read on to |sunset-configuration| for details.

INSTALLATION                                           *sunset-installation*

With a Plugin Manager:                  *sunset-installation-plugin-manager*

Vundle: ~

If you don't already have a preferred manager, I recommend installing Vundle
(http://github.com/gmarik/vundle). Once done, add the declaration for Sunset
to your `.vimrc`:

    Bundle 'amdt/sunset'

And install:

    :BundleInstall

Pathogen: ~

If you're using Pathogen, simply extract the archive to `$HOME/.vim/bundle` or
better yet, clone the Git repository. In a UNIX shell, for example:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/amdt/sunset.git

Using Vimball:                                 *sunset-installation-vimball*

Open the Vimball with Vim. For example, from a UNIX shell you might run:

    vim sunset.vba

Once loaded in Vim, run the following two commands:

    |:so| %
    |:q|

Manually:                                       *sunset-installation-manual*

Copy the files in the included zip archive into your |'runtimepath'|. The
directory tree for Sunset is as follows:

    /doc
        sunset.txt
    /plugin
        sunset.vim
    README.markdown

Place `sunset.txt` under `$HOME/.vim/doc` and `sunset.vim` under
`$HOME/.vim/plugin` where `$HOME` is the location of your `.vim` directory.

You can find this by typing '|:echo| |$HOME|'.

You can safely discard of `README.markdown`.

REQUIREMENTS                                           *sunset-requirements*

    * Sunset requires Vim 7.3.
    * Vim compiled with |+float| support. Use |:version| to check if this
      feature is available in your build.
    * Requires a system with |strftime()|, with the following format options:
        - %j returns the current day of the year.
        - %H returns the current hour of the day in 24-hour time.
        - %M returns the current minute of the hour.
    * A |colorscheme| with both light and dark variants, such as Solarized
      (http://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) or Hemisu
      (http://github.com/noahfrederick/Hemisu)

CONFIGURATION                                         *sunset-configuration*

'g:loaded_sunset'                                          *'loaded_sunset'*

Set to a non-0 value to disable Sunset, for example:

    let g:loaded_sunset = 1

'g:sunset_latitude' & 'g:sunset_longitude'               *'sunset_latitude'*
                                                        *'sunset_longitude'*

Note: If you push your dotfiles to Github, please see |sunset-privacy|.

The latitude and longitude of your location in decimal. Values North and East
must be positive values, those South and West must be negative.

London, for example, lies at 51 degrees, 30 minutes North; and 7 minutes West.

In decimal, this is 51.5 degrees North, 0.1167 degrees West.

If you lived in London, you might set these options as follows:

    let g:sunset_latitude = 51.5
    let g:sunset_longitude = -0.1167

If you lived in Tokyo (35 degrees, 40 minutes and 12 seconds North; 139
degrees, 46 minutes and 12 seconds East), you might set these options
as follows:

    let g:sunset_latitude = 35.67
    let g:sunset_longitude = 139.8

Note: Don't forget, negative values South and West.

'g:sunset_utc_offset'                                  *'sunset_utc_offset'*

The difference in hours between your timezone and Coordinated Universal Time.

For example:

    let g:sunset_utc_offset = 0 " London
    let g:sunset_utc_offset = 1 " London (British Summer Time)
    let g:sunset_utc_offset = 9 " Tokyo

Note: Sunset does not handle any daylight savings civil times.

A REMINDER ON PRIVACY                                       *sunset-privacy*

For those of us who publish our dotfiles on Github etc., please take this
as a gentle reminder that out of habit you might be about to publish your
whereabouts to the greater public. If this concerns you, using the location of
your nearest large city might suffice; Sunset will be plenty accurate enough.
