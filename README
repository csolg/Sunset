INTRODUCTION:

Sunset automatically sets 'background' when the sun rises and sets, and also when you start Vim. When the sun is up, or rises, it'll 'set background=light'. When the sun is down, or sets, it'll 'set background=dark'.

So as not to interrupt you, Sunset waits for four seconds (on the CursorHold event) after you've pressed a key or left insert mode before changing the background. If you change your background during the day or night, it'll respect that.

CONTRIBUTIONS:

If you feel that Sunset can be improved, pull requests and issues are appreciated and humbly requested, on Github at: http://github.com/amdt/sunset

REQUIREMENTS:

Vim compiled with +float support. Use ':version' to check if this feature is available in your build.

Requires a system with 'strftime()', with the following format options:
- %j returns the current day of the year.
- %H returns the current hour of the day in 24-hour time.
- %M returns the current minute of the hour.

A colorscheme with both light and dark variants, such as Solarized (http://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) or Hemisu (http://github.com/noahfrederick/Hemisu).
