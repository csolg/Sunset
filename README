INTRODUCTION:

Sunset automatically sets 'background' when the sun rises and sets, and also when you start Vim. When the sun is up, or rises, it'll 'set background=light'. When the sun is down, or sets, it'll 'set background=dark'.

Sunset can also change your 'colorscheme', your Powerline (https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline) theme, or anything else you can think of. See 'sunset_daytime_callback()' and 'sunset_nighttime_callback()' in the documentation for details.

So as not to interrupt you, Sunset waits for four seconds (on the CursorHold event) after you've pressed a key or left insert mode before changing the background. If you change your background during the day or night, it'll respect that.

CONTRIBUTIONS:

If you feel that Sunset can be improved, pull requests and issues are appreciated and humbly requested, on Github at: http://github.com/amdt/sunset
